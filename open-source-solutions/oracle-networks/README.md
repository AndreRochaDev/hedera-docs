# Oracle Networks

Oracle networks integrated with Hedera provide secure and reliable data feeds from off-chain sources to Hedera-based applications and smart contracts. These oracle networks act as bridges between the real world and the Hedera network, enabling the development of decentralized applications (dApps) that rely on external data.&#x20;

Check out some of the oracle networks integrated with Hedera listed below. Each Oracle network may have its own unique features and data offerings.&#x20;
